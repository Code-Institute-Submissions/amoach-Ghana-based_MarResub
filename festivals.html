         </h3>
         <p class="about-fst">No better way to end your year and welcome a new one!
            Afrochella has been an exclusively Ghanaian known festival and has never disappointed during the Christmas season! 
            Afronation as you most likely know has made a name for itself in just 2 years, and definitely not one to miss. The Festival Feels we're 
            offering provides you with tickets to both festivals 20% cheaper than if you were to purchase anywhere else. And as if this isn't 
            already an amazing offer, you'll also be invited to all the exclusive afterparties which will be taking place at Bloombar and Soho bar. 
            Package also includes transits to venues -Party bus! Pick ups will be from the following locations: Osu, East Legon and Spintex. Dropped
            once the day event is over and for chance to change and getready for the afterparties!

                    <br>The best way to be welcomed into Ghana, we're you'll get to party like a true Ghanaian as well as being immersed
                    into performances which will give you a little experience of some Ghanaian traditions.
                    Get down all day long with the likes of Ghana's very own hiplife grandfather Daddy Lumba to Stonebwoy to Juls. Josef Adamu will also
                    be curating his highly anticipated international tour of the 'Hair Appoinment' all week. Come to show out and have a makeshift 
                    photoshoot and go away with some mementos. Truly is a week of culture and partying!

                <p class="itinerary-fst"><b>3rd - 6th January 2022 Afronation!</b>
                    <br>This week will feel like a non-stop party as not only is there a crazy line up including Wizkid, Burna Boy and Ghana's very own 
                    Sarkodie, and so many others! The Ghanaian sun can get draining this time of the year so this location includes pools by the bars,
                    chill and mingle when you're not dancing away. It all takes place on a beach so also feel free to take a dip, no chance of dehydration
                    here! And as if that wasn't all enough to keep the party going, we'll be holding competitions throughout the week -maybe we'll ask you 
                    dance, maybe complete a dare, who knows; but you could win prizes such as spa weekends, VIP access all areas tickets and so much more!
